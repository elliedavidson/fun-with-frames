# fun-with-frames

This is a quick implementation of [Farcaster Frames](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/reference/frames/spec) deployed using Vercel. To customize, add the appropriate images in the `assets` directory.  Be sure to name them following the "slide-n.png" template. Next, update the `total_slides` variable in `app.py`. This example is meant to demonstrate registering for an event through a frame.  

To run locally: `python -m flask run`
